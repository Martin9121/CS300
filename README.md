 What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
 The problem that was being sloved was to have a way for advisors to access information about courses in the computer science program.

How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
I approached the problem by first analyzing the data structures that we have been working with through out the course. I weighed pros and cons of each and decided which one was best for the job. I went with the hash table.

How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
Whenever I encountered roadblocks, the first thing I did was look over the material in the ZyBooks to see if I can find a solution there. If the ZyBooks did not help, then I went online. If that did not work I went to my instructor. 

How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
My work on this project has expanded my approach to designing software and developing programs by reinforcing the habit of first creating a plan for the program. Analyze the problem and really think about what the best way to go about solving the problem. Many times there is more than one way to solve your problem but being able to identify the one that best fits your needs is an important skill to have.

How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
My work on this project has evolved the way I write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable by reinforcing the habit of leaving comments. There were a lot of roadblocks while working on the projects and I was really pressed for time. This meant that I had to continue the next day or sometimes even the day after. Leaving comments to remind myself why I did somethings or what exactly a function is doing helped a lot in keeping  me from forgetting and allowing me to quickly get back to working on the project.
